<h1>Sign up</h1>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
    <div style="text-align: center">
      If you don't feel like signing up for an account, feel free to use: example-1@railstutorial.org, example-2@railstutorial.org, example-3@railstutorial.org, ..., example-11@railstutorial.org (password is "password" for all 11 of those accounts; if it's anything different, someone else already claimed it).
      <br><br>
      <strong>Please</strong> don't use any information you deem sensitive (namely, your email address and the passwords that you use elsewhere). I strongly recommend using <a href="https://www.mailinator.com/">Mailinator</a> to get a disposable email address.
      <br><br>
      Also note that this web app is currently in development. The database <strong>will</strong> be reset multiple times during this process. So, if you can't seem to log in, you may need to sign up for an account again. This notice will be when database resets are no longer going to occur.
